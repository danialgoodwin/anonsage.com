Unfortunately, the option in Power BI desktop is not called 'z-order', but is called 'layer order'.

Here's how you can change the z-order:
1. Go to the 'View' tab
2. Check 'Selection Pane'
3. In the Selection pane, select 'Layer order'

Now, you can adjust the 'z' of all the visuals on the report page. You can also change the tab order in this selection pane. This also makes it a lot easier to select a certain visual when they are covering each other.
