title: Axinov
---
Just trying to pick a somewhat meaningful name that starts with an "A" and arbitrarily includes and "X" in it, and something that isn't already taken.

Thus, Axinov.

Nov translating to new.

Since this is a relatively unused word I've made up. It can start being the brand under which my development and programming work goes under. Hopefully, there will be less confusion in the future when it comes to finding programming tools.
