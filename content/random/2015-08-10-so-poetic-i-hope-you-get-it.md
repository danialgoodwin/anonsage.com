Rabbit rabbit duck duck<br/>
One of you has luck luck<br/>
If you do have luck luck<br/>
Go and make a buck buck<br/>

Hockey players puck puck<br/>
Army soldiers ruck ruck<br/>
Distance drivers truck truck<br/>
Gravity will suck suck<br/>

Formal wear we'll tuck tuck<br/>
Let's hope it's not<br/>
Rabbit rabbit duck duck<br/>

Alcoholics drink drunk<br/>
Philosophers think thunk<br/>
The Grinch has stink stunk<br/>
Artists can be pink punk<br/>
Plinko chips will plink plunk<br/>
The Titanic sink sunk<br/>
X-game drivers trick truck
