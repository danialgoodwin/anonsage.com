title: Dream Writing
---
Whenever I realize I'm in a dream, I generally just let it take its natural course. I haven't tried to drastically alter events yet. Though, I guess I can learn just as much lucid dreaming as regular dreaming.

Another idea, perhaps, in a dream I should try to write down what I remember about this life?
