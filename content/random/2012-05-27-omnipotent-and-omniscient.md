title: Omnipotent and Omniscient

Theoretically, if you are omnipotent (all-powerful) and omniscient (all-knowing), what do you do? What do you do after that?

Think past the first answer. The objective here is to think past the things that may be on the top of your head. What do you do after you think of everything?

ps - I wrote this down a year ago on my computer and am just now posting it online. Something else I also wrote about this was, "philosophy, not psychology." I'm still trying to figure out exactly why I wrote that part.. hmm...
