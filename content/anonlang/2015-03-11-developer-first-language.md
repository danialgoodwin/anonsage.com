title: Developer-First Language
---
What does a "developer-first language" entail?

What could a developer-first language entail?

- No boilerplate code and minimal typing.
- Ultimate reusability of code, including seemlessly using other devs' code. No fuss integration.
- Easiest discoverability of great open-source modular code.
- The best tooling for the language.
  - Automatically figure out space and time complexities.
- Abstractions on abstractions on abstractions to be more productive.
- GUI and game environment generation as easy as thinking about it.
- Fast.
- Tests write (and run) themselves. And, can automatically figure out test cases.
- One language that is great at everything (and cross-platform).
- Anything that may be seen as a limitation in the language can be modularized and replaced dynamically. (How about conditional imports/includes/requires/uses?)
- Easy concurrency. (How about everything off the main/UI thread by default? And, when updating UI, getting to the UI thread is automatic?)

To help out the above ideas:
- The language should be rigid when we need it to be and malleable when we want it to be.
- An evolving language.
- Internet connected(?)

What are some other high-level wants/needs?
