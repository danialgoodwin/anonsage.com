title: config.anon
---
At first I was considering that all projects must have a `config.anon` file. It seems like it would be useful to define defaults, and it probably will be. But, the quick question is about whether or not the config file should be required for *all* projects.

There are plenty of times when quick snippets and scripts are created. We don't want to force the creation of two files when one would suffice.

Hmmm, that seemed easy enough.. no, the `config.anon` files won't be required, but it would be part of best practices for larger projects.

Later, I'll get into more of the project structure.
