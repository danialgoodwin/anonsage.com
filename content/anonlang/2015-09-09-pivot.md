title: Pivot

Since the initial scope is way too large, I need to cut back on ideas in order to actually get something published.

Current specific-ish goal: Do some API-Driven Development so that I can better know how the code should look and be used. Then, work bottom-up and top-down after that.

I was thinking goal would be 'show a window'. But, honestly, that's still a ways off because I want to know how I'm going to show that window first. 'Show a plain window' will be be one of the first built apps though. ;)

(Disclaimer: May change)
