{"html":"<p>This blog (straightchaos.blogpost.com) was created just because I like oxymorons, paradoxes, and double meaning.</p>\n<p>One interpretation of &#39;Straight Chaos&#39; is straight-forward chaos, a quick meaning. But, the other main interpretation of &#39;Straight Chaos&#39; is that it implies that this particular chaos is neat, orderly, symmetrical, and without deviation. Thus, pretty much opposite. Without a lot of extra context, you can&#39;t be sure which meaning the phrase is taking.</p>\n<p>Here are some more of my favorite possible oxymorons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Simply Advanced: In fact, I liked this one so much that I purchased the domain name and created a company with the same name.</li>\n<li>I forget the rest because I haven&#39;t used them as much. But, there is definitely a list somewhere that I want to put online for easy referencing.</li>\n<li>My favorite username: Anonsage. Two interpretations of this can be &quot;A non-sage&quot; and &quot;Anon(ymous) Sage&quot;. Both are great. Here&#39;s the story on how I picked this username/alias: I liked the sound of &quot;Anon&quot; when it was the default attribute to works of unknown origin. And, I just like the non-common word &quot;sage&quot;. After exhaustive testing of different ways that I could combine different words that I like... finally, working memory put these two together.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Though, I should be posting online more with this alias. By default, when I register for new websites, I use my name as username just so that others can&#39;t have that [possibly more] important identity.</p>\n","title":"Straight Chaos","file":"2013-09-24-straight-chaos.md","date":"2013-09-24","slug":"2013-09-24-straight-chaos"}
