{"html":"<p>Imagine you are in a kitchen and you see cabinets around, both low and high.</p>\n<p>Why is it commonplace to have doors on all of those cabinets?</p>\n<p>It seems to be a hindrance to have two extra steps (open and close) to access anything in those cabinets.</p>\n<p>Well, there is one reason some people might use... saying that it makes the kitchen look nicer. So, that&#39;s the main trade-off... easier functionality vs (arguably) better looking.</p>\n<p>One real reason to have doors on cabinets is if you purposely want to make it harder to get in, especially for small children and pets. Though, that&#39;s mainly just for the lower cabinets, not a reason for the top cabinets.</p>\n<p>A better reason for doors on the higher cabinets is if you are in an earthquake zone and worry about things falling out.</p>\n<p>Having said those reasons, what if I&#39;m in an area without earthquakes, children, and pets and I care more about functionality than looks? Then, it seems that I don&#39;t need any doors hiding stuff from me and guests.</p>\n<p>I&#39;d love to hear any other thoughts.</p>\n","title":"Why have doors on cabinets?","file":"2015-11-19-why-have-doors-on-cabinets.md","date":"2015-11-19","slug":"2015-11-19-why-have-doors-on-cabinets"}
