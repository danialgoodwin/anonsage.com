{"html":"<p>The current leading syntax for Anonlang comments is the use of <code>;;</code> for single-line comments and for multi-line comments to use <code>[;</code> and <code>;]</code>.</p>\n<p>The semi-colon is in a highly prime location on the keyboard to be used for something that is used very often. </p>\n<p>Comments may not be something that is or should be used very often. Especially considering that the dash could still be used instead like in Haskell, which uses <code>--</code> for single-line comments and for multi-line comments use <code>[-</code> and <code>-]</code>. Still not really considering using slashes because those two different styles are still being saved for other language features.</p>\n<p>One potential issue with the double-dash is that it looks like a decrement operator. Haskell doesn&#39;t don&#39;t have to worry about that issue because the functional language doesn&#39;t support that operation. Anonlang currently also doesn&#39;t support it, but it hasn&#39;t been ruled off the table. Though having both would be more tough to parse for compiler and perhaps for human readability.</p>\n","title":"Comment Syntax","file":"2015-10-11-comment-syntax.md","date":"2015-10-11","slug":"2015-10-11-comment-syntax"}
