    label1(id, name, food) [
        <span class=hljs-number>1</span>, A Name, fish;
        <span class=hljs-number>2</span>, Another, pizza;
        <span class=hljs-number>3</span>, Boise, watermelon;
    ]
    label2(id, name, ingredientA, ingredientB, ingredientC=none) [
        <span class=hljs-number>1</span>, popsicle, water, heat extractor;
        <span class=hljs-number>2</span>, popcorn, unpopcorn, heat;
        <span class=hljs-number>3</span>, pop, water, sugar, bubbles;
    ]
]</code></pre><p>The above certainly fits in the aforementioned potential rules/requirements, but one drawback is that it doesn't allow the direct support for CSV because of the semi-colon. One idea could be to have a "meta-params" option:</p> <pre class=language-javascriptreact><code>label1(id, name, food)(format=csv) [
    <span class=hljs-number>1</span>, A Name, fish
    <span class=hljs-number>2</span>, Another, pizza
    <span class=hljs-number>3</span>, Boise, watermelon
]</code></pre><p>Hmmm, then that requires a keyword. So, another idea could be to have a <code>.format[csv]</code> after the map, but developers don't read the bottom first. So, the keyword idea is still a better choice so far.</p> <p>It seems great to be able to back-support other formats neat in code. And, adapters for each type can be built easily enough. Maybe we could also allow the tooling to automatically code-generate between formats to put there also.</p> <p>Hmm, meta programming constructs could quickly get messy also. May be best to have automatic converters built-in. Though, a nice meta feature would be being able to specify the tradeoffs wanted in an algorithm -- less space or less time.</p> <p>If no meta, then maybe a format could be like:</p> <pre class=language-javascriptreact><code>label1 = csv[
