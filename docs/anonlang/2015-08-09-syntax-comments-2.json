{"html":"<p>This is an extension of the previous post &quot;Syntax: Comments&quot;. In that previous post the final thought was using <code>;;;</code> to mark the beginning and end of a multi-line comment.</p>\n<p>The major drawback of that is not being able to tell by looking at one in which direction the comment is.</p>\n<p>So, to alleviate that issue, here&#39;s another proposed idea: use <code>[;</code> to begin a multi-line comment and us <code>;]</code> to end a multi-line comment.</p>\n<p>The reasoning to use the square brackets is because they are already being used to define blocks/scopes of code, this is just another &quot;special&quot; block of code.</p>\n<p>Let&#39;s try a few examples:</p>\n<p><strong>Before:</strong></p>\n<pre class='language-javascriptreact'><code>;;; This data holds the keys to the\nmulti-line universe. ;;;\nmyData [\n    ;;; First, Last, Address, Job ;;;\n    John, Smith, <span class=\"hljs-number\">123</span> Main, Programmer\n    Jane, Doe, <span class=\"hljs-number\">456</span> East, Engineer\n]</code></pre><p><strong>Now:</strong></p>\n<pre class='language-javascriptreact'><code>[; This data holds the keys to the\nmulti-line universe. ;]\nmyData [\n    [; First, Last, Address, Job ;]\n    John, Smith, <span class=\"hljs-number\">123</span> Main, Programmer\n    Jane, Doe, <span class=\"hljs-number\">456</span> East, Engineer\n]</code></pre><p>The triple-semi-colon does seem easier to type, but that might not be worth the price of needed more tooling to see where the comment really is without checking the entire file.</p>\n","title":"Syntax: Comments 2","file":"2015-08-09-syntax-comments-2.md","date":"2015-08-09","slug":"2015-08-09-syntax-comments-2"}
