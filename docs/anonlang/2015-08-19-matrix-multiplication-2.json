{"html":"<p>After more review and thinking, the matrix multiplication &quot;metaphor&quot; isn&#39;t quite correct enough possibly.</p>\n<p>Instead of a <code>[model] . [data]</code>, we may want to think of the [model] more as a type/alias that we can create instances of to fill the attributes.</p>\n<p>So, it would possibly be more accurate to say <code>[data] :: [model]</code>, which indicates that the &#39;data&#39; is of type &#39;model&#39;.</p>\n<p>Oh, and the main reason the matrix multiplication might not work as well as the above is because the matrix multiplication can have the different size of out.. for example a [3x2] . [2x3] would output a [3x3]?</p>\n<p>Hmmm, actually now that I think about it a bit more while typing this, matrix multiplication could in fact be the right idea again. Well, at least require more thought before closing entirely. ;)</p>\n<p>A list of &#39;model&#39; attributes would be defined in a [1xN] and the list of data to match that would in a [Nx1] size matrix. Then, that should create a [1x1] ... hmm, nevermind for now. I need to relearn more linear algebra again.</p>\n<p>Another thought.. perhaps a language shouldn&#39;t be based on linear algebra is it is going to be able to do more than that.</p>\n","title":"Matrix Multiplication 2","file":"2015-08-19-matrix-multiplication-2.md","date":"2015-08-19","slug":"2015-08-19-matrix-multiplication-2"}
