Usually, ImageMagick is my go-to for image manipulation, but this time I wanted to explore a few other options since I haven&#39;t done it in a long time.</p>\n<p>To limit my research, I focused just on PNG compression libraries.

But, the most important thing to me is which tool was the best. Presenting, <a href=\"https://pngquant.org/\">pngquant</a>. It retains alpha transparency, it reduces the color palette, it can create &#39;lossy&#39; PNGs, and more.
