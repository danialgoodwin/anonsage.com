{"html":"<p>Today, I feel really good on what I have accomplished.</p>\n<p>After hearing about <a href=\"https://svelte.dev/\">Svelte</a> last week and reading more about it, I really like it&#39;s direction and UX. And, today I implemented my newest blog tech stack, which includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Svelte</li>\n<li>Sapper: App framework, router, static (or dynamic) site, pre-fetching</li>\n<li>Markdown: Text-based content</li>\n<li>Rollup: Code-splitting, dynamic imports</li>\n<li>GitHub Pages: Hosting</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I would describe Svelte as the next generation of Vue. They have similar styles in that components are all-inclusive: HTML, JavaScript, and CSS in one file for each component.</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s a great overview of Svelte, including pros and cons: <a href=\"https://github.com/feltcoop/why-svelte\">github.com/feltcoop/why-svelte</a></p>\n<p>This is probably my 5th ish complete overhaul of my blog and wiki website. Over the years, I have slowly been getting more control of the site, and understanding more of the code that generates the site. So, no more &#39;magic&#39; now.</p>\n<p>Also, just to make sure I didn&#39;t want to do it all from scratch, I made a quick minimal static blog generator in Python. Just provide posts in markdown, and the script provides a nice static blog: <a href=\"https://github.com/danialgoodwin/minimal--static-blog-generator\">github.com/danialgoodwin/minimal--static-blog-generator</a></p>\n","title":"New static blog site","file":"2020-03-22-new-static-blog-site.md","date":"2020-03-22","slug":"2020-03-22-new-static-blog-site"}
