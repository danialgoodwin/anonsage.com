{"html":"<p>I randomly come up with app ideas and usually write them down in my notebook. Sometimes, I feel like sharing my many different ideas with the world so that I am forced to come up with even better ideas.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Screen share mobile-to-mobile </li>\n<li>Permanent Clipboard</li>\n<li>StumbleUpon Mobile App version</li>\n<li>Facebook without Facebook app - basically, pull Fb data to a Contacts app and include messages</li>\n<li>Range [distance] Finder using camera, or sound, or shadows</li>\n<li>App that creates real-world-value. Perhaps, something like a mobile version of Mechanical Turk or Bitcoin Generator et cetera.</li>\n<li>How-to guides for specific topics</li>\n<li>Connect game controllers to phones (wire, Bluetooth, built-in stand...)</li>\n<li>Fire-starter, possibly need hardware like capacitor to help generate a spark</li>\n<li>Taser app, extended from above. Or just use vibrate and fake sounds.</li>\n<li>Log everything app</li>\n<li>3D Where&#39;s Waldo or 3D iSpy or 3D Highlights. Instead of just finding everything on screen you must orientate the phone different ways to pan around (or just allow touch scrolling)</li>\n<li>Find Ghosts game app, extended from above. To be played in an open field. Can only see ghosts when looking through phone</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I know of many types of app, but I haven&#39;t heard of these ones yet. And I deleted just one idea that I decided to start working on right now. To be shown later. =b</p>\n<p>Anybody may use these ideas for their personal apps. I would just like to hear if others are interested in these types of apps in the comments.</p>\n","title":"Random App Ideas","file":"2012-07-03-random-app-ideas.md","date":"2012-07-03","slug":"2012-07-03-random-app-ideas","next":{"slug":"2014-01-31-ux-progress-bars","name":"(UX) Progress Bars"}}
